      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Would you like to come out from work or school to a clean car? I would like to create a website that offers mobile car detail service. The website would allow for customer to be able to submit a form with times of availability so the detailing service could schedule the service.  It would also provide a list of services that the customer could choose from.  This part would be the first and most basic part of the website development.  Eventually the website would allow for the customer to book times base off the availability off the calendar.  This feature would require more technical skills for development but would assist the owner/operator and free up scheduling time so they can operate the business. Mobile car detailing makes sense in this fast-paced world. Being able to schedule this service to happen while you are at school or working at the office.  To come out to a clean car is something that everyone needs.</p>  <!-- change this -->
