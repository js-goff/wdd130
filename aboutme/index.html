    <p>I am from Kaysville Utah.  Born and raised here and am currently raising our children here.  I am married to Eloina Guerrero Goff for 27 years.<br>
       Married in the Bountiful Temple. Our children Carlos (24) Emilia (15) and Cristina (14). Ostia is our best friend.<br> 
       Carlos and I love to watch BYU football together. Eloina and I met at Pizza Hut where we were both Managers. <br></p>
    <p>Eloina is teaching Spanish full time at the local Junior High. I work for the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation as the Director of IT for the past 14 years.<br>
       The Foundation is responsible for management of the three Major Olympic Venues constructed for the Salt Lake 2002 Winter Olympics.<br> 
       Utah Olympic Park, Utah Olympic Oval, and Soldier Hollow Nordic Center.  I love bringing my family to major sporting events hosted at these venues.<br>
       I also enjoying working at these venues. It is very satisfying when our athletes win medals at the World Cups or the Olympics<br>
       knowing that you had a small part in helping them achieve their dreams.<br></p>         
       I am CIT major. BYU-I has giving me the opportunity to return to school and finish my degree.  I will forever be grateful for this.<br>
